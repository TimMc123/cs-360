- Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
  
    In this course, we made a weight tracking app where the user had to have a username and password to log into their app. After logging in the user was able to input a start weight and store it in a database. We then were able to add, delete, or edit the items in the database through the app. Once these entrees are submitted, they are then listed where you can see time.
  
- What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

    For this project we needed a couple of screens to adhere to the requirements listed to make a functional app for the user.
  
  -	Login – this page is the first page the user comes to where they have to insert their username and password to access their data.
  -	Sign up – This page is next in the branch only if the user doesn’t already have an account. They must sign up, then will be redirected back to the login in page.
  -	Main screen – Once passed the login in page this will be the next page, where users will have a dashboard to show weight list.
  -	Data entry - This page is where the user will enter data about weight and date.
  -	Datalist – This page shows the list of data entry in the database, and on this page the user will be able to edit and/or delete data entry form the database.
  -	Setting/notification – This page while not full developed yet, will be the settings page. I have only added the ability to access the SMS notifications, but plan on     
    adding more settings as the app develops.
   	
-	How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?
  
    When starting this project, I had all these ideas to add to the app and all these things I wanted to add. I had to slow my role because it was too much, it was my first app, so I was super ambitious. I ended up scaling down and adding only what was necessary to the project. Like I said, I’m new to app design in android studio so I was learning as I go, and this was taking way to much time and my project wasn’t going to get finished on time. In the future this can help because I’ll always look back at this project and remember to slow down and really think about what needs to be done and what I want to add, without staining the time frame I’m working in.
  
-	How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?
  
    The first couple of times I submitted my apps they wouldn’t run due to my manifest file not being coded properly. So, to ensure that it was functional, I made sure to keep an eye out for this file and make sure it was up to date. I also chose different device modules in the emulator to see how it would function on different phones.
  
-	Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
  
    Looking at the full app design and development I had a couple problems that popped up here and there. One was like I mentioned before my app wouldn’t run in the emulator and I couldn’t figure out why. After about 4 hours I googled it, and it pointed me to the manifest file. I wasn’t creating an activity class, so it wasn’t adding it automatically to the file, I had too manually do it. Once I figured that out it was smooth sailing from there. The next problem I had was the coding process, I managed to get it with help from the tutoring service the school provides. It helped me out a lot, I just wish I had more time to learn it all for myself without help before the project was due.
  
-	In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

    I think my problem-solving skills were tested in this project and I was able to overcome the issue. I was able to narrow the problem down and troubleshoot the problem and find the problem and fix it. I also think my UI was pretty good too, however after I got done with it, I noticed it looks similar to a lot of other apps, but I think that’s because it a very basic UI design.
